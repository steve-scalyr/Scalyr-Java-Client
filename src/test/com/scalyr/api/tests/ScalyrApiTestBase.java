   * Some of these tests involve multiple racing threads of execution. For now, we're relying on
   * simple clock delays (e.g. Thread.sleep) to line up the execution. Here are notes on how to
   * remove the time dependency and make the tests more robust -- it's a lot of work, so I'm not
   * doing it at this point.
   *
   * - Mock out the system clock. Review all callers to System, Thread.sleep in the codebase,
   *   have them use the mocked clock instead.
   * - Review all uses of wait() with a timeout, replace them with the mocked clock. (This seems
   *   tricky.)
   * - Mocked Thread.sleep needs to block until all other threads run as far as they ought. Could
   *   use semaphores for this.
